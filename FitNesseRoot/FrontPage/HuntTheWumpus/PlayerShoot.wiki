Feature: Player shoots arrows

  As the player
  I want to be able to shoot arrows
  So that I can shoot the wumpus and win the game

  Background:
    Given player starts in cave 0
    And enemy player starts in cave 5
    And wumpus starts in cave 18
    And bat 1 starts in cave 19
    And bat 2 starts in cave 13
    And pit 1 starts in cave 3
    And pit 2 starts in cave 13

  Scenario: Player shoots the wumpus
  If the player shoots a cave that contains the wumpus, the wumpus should die and game should be over
    Given player starts in cave 9
    And wumpus starts in cave 18
    When player moves to cave 10
    And player shoots at cave 18
    Then wumpus will be dead
    And game is won

  Scenario: Player misses the wumpus and it remains asleep
  If the arrow misses the wumpus cave, the wumpus may remain a sleep and not move
    Given player starts in cave 0
    And wumpus starts in cave 18
    When player shoots at cave 1
    And wumpus remains asleep
    Then wumpus will be at cave 18
    And game is still on

  Scenario Outline: Player misses the wumpus and it wakes up and moves
  If the player shoots but misses the wumpus cave, the wumpus may wake up and move to a linked cave
  If player starts in that cave, the wumpus will eat him
    Given player starts in cave <PlayerStartingCave>
    And wumpus starts in cave <WumpusStartingCave>
    When player moves to cave <PlayerNextCave>
    And player shoots at cave <CaveToShootAt>
    But wumpus wakes up and moves from cave <WumpusStartingCave> to cave <WumpusNextCave>
    Then wumpus will be at cave <WumpusNextCave>
    And game is <GameStatus>

    Examples:
      | PlayerStartingCave | WumpusStartingCave | WumpusNextCave | PlayerNextCave | CaveToShootAt | GameStatus |
      | 9                  | 18                 | 19             | 10             | 11            | still on   |
      | 9                  | 18                 | 10             | 10             | 11            | lost       |

  Scenario: Player runs out of arrows
  If the player runs out of arrows before killing the wumpus, the game is over
    Given player starts in cave 0
    And player has 1 arrow remaining
    When player shoots at cave 4
    Then game is lost

  Scenario: Player shoots an arrow through multiple caves
  The player can choose up to 5 caves to shoot at
    Given player starts in cave 0
    And wumpus starts in cave 18

      | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 18 |
    Then wumpus will be dead

    When player shoots an arrow at caves
      | 15 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 3 |
    But cave 15 is not linked to 0, so arrow goes to 7 instead
    And cave 3 is not linked to 10, so arrow goes to 18 instead
    Then wumpus will be dead
    And game is won

  Scenario: Player shoots an arrow through multiple caves but the arrow get back to him and kills him
  If the arrow enters the player's cave, the player dies and game is over
    Given player starts in cave 0
    When player shoots an arrow at caves
